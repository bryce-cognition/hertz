Code Coverage Comparison for transport.go

Before improvements:
No previous coverage data available.

After improvements:

pkg/network/netpoll/transport.go:
- init: 100.0%
- cancelContext: 100.0%
- NewTransporter: 100.0%
- ListenAndServe: 91.9%
- Close: 100.0%
- Shutdown: 100.0%

pkg/network/standard/transport.go:
- serve: 79.2%
- ListenAndServe: 100.0%
- Close: 100.0%
- Shutdown: 100.0%
- NewTransporter: 100.0%

Summary:
The implementation of tests for the Transporter interface methods has significantly improved the code coverage for transport.go. Most functions now have 100% coverage, with only ListenAndServe in the netpoll implementation at 91.9% and serve in the standard implementation at 79.2%. These areas may require further attention to achieve full coverage.

Next steps:
1. Focus on improving coverage for ListenAndServe in netpoll/transport.go
2. Enhance test cases for serve in standard/transport.go
3. Consider adding edge cases and error scenarios to further improve overall test quality
